# Weather Project

This project will use the openweathermap api to show the user current weather information. 
The user should be able to enter a city name. If the city does not exist he should be notified. Otherwise, the weather information for the city will be added to the screen. The user can do this multiple times which will then show weather information of all the cities. The user should not be able to add the same city a second time.
